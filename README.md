#  Hello, I’m Jarryd Carelse  

## About Me  
I’m an Interactive Development student at Open Window in South Africa, currently building my skills in mobile development, frontend engineering, backend APIs, and UI/UX design. I enjoy creating digital products that feel clean, intuitive, and reliable — from dashboards to mobile apps and AI-powered tools.

I approach every project as an opportunity to learn, grow, and solve real-world problems with practical, user-focused solutions.
